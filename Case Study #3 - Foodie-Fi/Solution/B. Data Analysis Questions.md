and p.plan_id = 3
group by plan_name;
```
| plan_name  | cust_count |
|------------|------------|
| pro annual | 195        |

### 9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
```TSQL
with join_date as (
select customer_id, min(start_date) as join_date
from foodie_fi.subscriptions group by customer_id),
upgrade_date as (select customer_id, start_date as upgrade_date
from foodie_fi.subscriptions where plan_id = 3 )
select avg(DATEDIFF(day, join_date, upgrade_date))  avg_days_to_upgrade
from join_date j
inner join upgrade_date u
on j.customer_id = u.customer_id;
```
| avg_days_to_upgrade |
|---------------------|
| 104                 |

On average, it takes avg 104 days for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi.

---
### 10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)?
To solve this question: 
* Utilize 2 CTEs in the previous question: ```trialPlan``` and ```annualPlan``` to calculate the number of days between ```trial_date``` and ```annual_date```, then put that to new CTE named ```datesDiff```
* Create a recursive CTE named ```daysRecursion``` to generate 30-day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)
* Left join from ```daysRecursion``` to ```datesDiff``` 
    
```TSQL
WITH join_date AS ( 
                   SELECT customer_id,
                          MIN(start_date) AS join_date
                   FROM   foodie_fi.subscriptions
                   GROUP  BY customer_id
                  ),

                   SELECT customer_id,
                          start_date AS upgrade_date
                   FROM   foodie_fi.subscriptions
                   WHERE  plan_id = 3
                   GROUP  BY customer_id, start_date
                   ),
  buckets AS ( 
                  SELECT

				  when DATEDIFF(day,join_date, upgrade_date) between 331 and 360 then '331 - 360'
				  end AS bucket,
				  u.customer_id,
				  DATEDIFF(day,join_date, upgrade_date) as days_took
                 FROM   join_date AS j
                  JOIN   upgrade_date AS u
                  ON     j.customer_id = u.customer_id
                                  )
select cast (bucket as text) as period,
       count(customer_id) as cust_count,
       avg(days_took) as average_days
FROM   buckets
GROUP  BY bucket
order by bucket;
```
| period      | cust_count | average_days |
|-------------|------------|--------------|
| 0 - 30      | 49         | 9            |
| 31 - 60     | 24         | 42           |

### 11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?
```TSQL
with downgraded_basic as (
select customer_id,plan_id, start_date,
case when plan_id = 2 and lead(plan_id) over(partition by customer_id order by start_date) = 1 then 1
else 0 end as downgraded_basic
from foodie_fi.subscriptions
where DATEPART(year, start_date) = 2020
)
select sum(downgraded_basic) as downgraded from downgraded_basic;
```
| downgraded  |

| 0           |

There were no customers downgrading from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020.
