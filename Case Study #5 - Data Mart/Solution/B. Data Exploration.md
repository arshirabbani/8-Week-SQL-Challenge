### 8. Which age_band and demographic values contribute the most to Retail sales?
```TSQL
declare @retailsales bigint = (select sum(sales) from data_mart.clean_weekly_sales where platform = 'Retail')

select age_band, demographic,sum(sales) as sales,--@retailsales,
round(cast (100.0* sum(sales)/ @retailsales as float),2) as contributions
from data_mart.clean_weekly_sales
where platform = 'Retail'
group by age_band, demographic
order by contributions desc;
```
| age_band      | demographic | sales         | contributions |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| unknown       | unknown     | 16067285533   | 40.52         |
| Retirees      | Families    | 6634686916    | 16.73         |
| Retirees      | Couples     | 6370580014    | 16.07         |
| Middle Aged   | Families    | 4354091554    | 10.98         |
| Young Adults  | Couples     | 2602922797    | 6.56          |
| Middle Aged   | Couples     | 1854160330    | 4.68          |
| Young Adults  | Families    | 1770889293    | 4.47          |


The highest retail sales are contributed by *unknown* ```age_band``` and ```demographic``` at 40.52% followed by *retired families* at 16.73% and *retired couples* at 16.07%.

### 9. Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?
```TSQL
select calendar_year, platform,
round(avg(avg_transaction),0) as avg_transactions_row,
sum(sales)/sum(transactions) as avg_transactions_group
from data_mart.clean_weekly_sales
group by calendar_year, platform
order by calendar_year;
```
| calendar_year | platform | avg_transactions_row | avg_transactions_group |
|---------------|----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| 2018          | Retail   | 43                   | 36                     |
| 2018          | Shopify  | 188                  | 192                    |
| 2019          | Retail   | 42                   | 36                     |
| 2019          | Shopify  | 178                  | 183                    |
| 2020          | Shopify  | 175                  | 179                    |
| 2020          | Retail   | 41                   | 36                     |


What's the difference between ```avg_transaction_row``` and ```avg_transaction_group```?
* ```avg_transaction_row``` is the average transaction of each individual row in the dataset 
* ```avg_transaction_group``` is the average transaction of each ```platform``` in each ```calendar_year```

The average transaction size for each year by platform is actually ```avg_transaction_group```.
