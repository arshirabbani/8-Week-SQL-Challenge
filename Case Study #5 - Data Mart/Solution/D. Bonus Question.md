# ðŸ›’ Case Study #5 - Data Mart
## D. Bonus Question
Which areas of the business have the highest negative impact in sales metrics performance in 2020 for the 12 week before and after period?
  * ```region```
  * ```platform```
  * ```age_band```

  * ```customer_type```
  
Do you have any further recommendations for Dannyâ€™s team at Data Mart or any interesting insights based off this analysis?

## Solution
First, using the technique in part C to find the ```week_number``` of ```2020-06-15```.
```TSQL
--Find the week_number of '2020-06-15' (@weekNum=25)
DECLARE @weekNum int = (
  SELECT DISTINCT week_number
  FROM clean_weekly_sales
  WHERE week_date = '2020-06-15'
  AND calendar_year =2020)
```
Then, depending on the area we want to analyze, change the column name in the ```SELECT``` and  ```GROUP BY```. 

Remember to include the ```DECLARE @weekNum``` in the beginning of each part below.

### 1. Sales changes by ```regions```
```TSQL
with saleschange as (
select region,
sum(case when week_number between @weeknum-12 and @weeknum-1 then sales end) as before_sales,
sum(case when week_number between @weeknum and @weeknum+11 then sales end) as after_sales
from data_mart.clean_weekly_sales
group by region)
select *,
round(cast (100* (after_sales - before_sales)as float)/before_sales,2) as sales_change_pct
from saleschange order by region;
```
| region          | before_sales | after_sales  | sales_change_pct |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| AFRICA          | 4942976910   | 4997516159   | 1.1              |
| ASIA            | 4613242689   | 4551927271   | -1.33            |
| CANADA          | 1244662705   | 1234025206   | -0.85            |
| EUROPE          | 328141414    | 344420043    | 4.96             |
| OCEANIA         | 6698586333   | 6640244793   | -0.87            |
| SOUTH AMERICA   | 611056923    | 608981392    | -0.34            |
| USA             | 1967554887   | 1960297502   | -0.37            |


**Insights and recommendations:** 
* Overall, the sales of most countries decreased after changing packages. 
* The highest negative impact was in ```ASIA``` with -1.33%. 
Danny should reduce the number of products with sustainable packages here.
* Only ```EUROPE``` saw a significant increase of 4.96% followed by ```AFRICA``` with 1.1%. These are areas that Danny should invest more.

from data_mart.clean_weekly_sales
group by platform)
select *,
round(cast (100* (after_sales - before_sales)as float)/before_sales,2) as sales_change_pct
from saleschange order by platform;

```
| platform | before_sales | after_sales | sales_change_pct |
|----------|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| Retail   | 19886040272  | 19768576165 | -0.59            |

from data_mart.clean_weekly_sales
group by age_band)
select *,
