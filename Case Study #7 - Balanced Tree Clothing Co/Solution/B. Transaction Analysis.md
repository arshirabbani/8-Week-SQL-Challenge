## B. Transaction Analysis
### 1. How many unique transactions were there?
```TSQL
select count(distinct(txn_id)) as unique_txn from balanced_tree.sales;
```
| unique_txn  |
|-------------|
| 2500        |

---
### 2. What is the average unique products purchased in each transaction?
```TSQL
with unique_prod_cnt as (
select txn_id, count(distinct prod_id) as unique_prod_cnt 
from balanced_tree.sales
group by txn_id)
select avg(unique_prod_cnt) as avg_unique_prod_cnt from unique_prod_cnt;
```
| avg_unique_prod_cnt  |
|----------------------|
| 6                    |

---
### 3. What are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values for the revenue per transaction?
```TSQL
WITH transaction_revenue AS (
with revenue as (
select txn_id, sum(qty*price) as revenue from balanced_tree.sales
group by txn_id)
select distinct 
PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) within group (order by revenue) over() as revenue_25th,
PERCENTILE_CONT(0.50) within group (order by revenue) over() as revenue_50th,
PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) within group (order by revenue) over() as revenue_75th
from revenue;
```
| revenue_25th | revenue_50th | revenue_75th  |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| 375.75       | 509.5        | 647           |

---
### 4. What is the average discount value per transaction?
```TSQL
with discounted_txn as (
select txn_id, sum(qty*price*discount/100.0) as discounted_txn from balanced_tree.sales
group by txn_id)
select cast(avg(discounted_txn) as decimal(10,2)) as avg_discounted_txn
from discounted_txn;
```
| avg_discounted_txn  |
|---------------------|
| 62.49               |

---
### 5. What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs non-members?
```TSQL
select 
cast (100.0* count(distinct case when member = 1 then txn_id end)/ count(distinct txn_id) as float) as member_pct,
cast(100.0* count(distinct case when member = 0 then txn_id end)/ count(distinct txn_id) as float) as non_member_pct
from balanced_tree.sales;
```
| members_pct | non_members_pct  |
|-------------|------------------|
| 60.2        | 39.8             |

---
### 6. What is the average revenue for member transactions and non-member transactions?
```TSQL
with total_revenue as (
select (case when member = 1 then 'member' else 'non-member' end) as member,
txn_id, sum(qty*price) as total_revenue
from balanced_tree.sales 
group by member, txn_id)
select member , cast(avg(1.0*total_revenue) as decimal(10,2)) as avg_revenue
from total_revenue
group by member;
```
| member     | avg_revenue  |
|------------|--------------|
| member     | 516.27       |
| non-member | 515.04       |
